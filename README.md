Music visualizer stylized in a manner similar to Apple Music for iOS.

I spent a very long time precisely mimicking Apple Music, probably way too long. Enjoy!

## How to use:

- Press the play button to play a demo song. It may take a while for the song to download, so please be patient :)

- Add your own music using the three-dots button. Metadata readability should work for all file types.

- Click the title to toggle the explicit icon.

The app looks and works best on 1920x1080 resolution. If you are experiencing scaling issues, try zooming in/out.
